The vision is just to create a simple site where gamers can go and calculate how long it will take them to finish a particular game, based on how many hours a day/week they are able to allocate towards gaming.

I would like to add some steam integration in the future, possibly to link a user's account to view how long it would take to finish some of the unplayed games in their library. TBD.
